    <<~PROMPT
      I need to diagnose a car problem with the following details:

      Vehicle: #{vehicle_year} #{vehicle_make} #{vehicle_model}
      Reported symptoms: #{symptoms}
      
      As an expert automotive diagnostic system:
      1. Analyze the most likely causes based on the symptoms and vehicle
      2. Provide a prioritized list of potential causes (most likely first)
      3. For each cause, explain:
         - What components might be failing
         - Why this would cause the reported symptoms
         - How this issue can be confirmed (tests or checks)
      4. Recommend the safest, most cost-effective diagnostic approach
      5. Estimate repair complexity (DIY vs professional) and potential cost range
      
      Focus on practical diagnostic advice that would help a mechanic or car owner.
