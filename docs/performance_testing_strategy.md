# Performance Testing Strategy

## 1. Testing Objectives
- Ensure the application can handle 100k+ concurrent users
- Maintain <2s response time under load
- Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
- Ensure system stability and reliability

## 2. Testing Types

### 2.1 Load Testing
- **Objective**: Verify system behavior under expected load
- **Scenarios**:
  - User authentication flow
  - Diagnosis request processing
  - Document retrieval and processing
  - Concurrent user sessions

### 2.2 Stress Testing
- **Objective**: Determine breaking points
- **Scenarios**:
  - Gradual increase in user load
  - Sudden traffic spikes
  - Sustained peak loads

### 2.3 Endurance Testing
- **Objective**: Identify memory leaks and resource issues
- **Duration**: 24-72 hour test runs
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Memory usage patterns
  - Database connection leaks
  - Background job processing

## 3. Test Environment

### 3.1 Infrastructure
- Match production environment specifications
- Isolated network to prevent external interference
- Monitoring tools in place

### 3.2 Test Data
- Production-like dataset
- Anonymized real user data when possible
- Representative document corpus for RAG

## 4. Tools

### 4.1 Load Generation
- **k6**: For scripting and executing load tests
- **Locust**: For Python-based test scenarios
- **JMeter**: For complex test scenarios

### 4.2 Monitoring
- **Application**: New Relic, Skylight
- **Infrastructure**: Datadog, AWS CloudWatch
- **Database**: pgHero, PgBouncer metrics
- **Caching**: Redis metrics

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 5.1 Response Times
- API endpoints: <200ms p95
- Page loads: <2s p95
- AI processing: <5s for initial response

### 5.2 System Health
- CPU usage: <70% under peak load
- Memory usage: <80% of available
- Error rate: <0.1% of requests
- Background job latency: <1s p95

## 6. Test Scenarios

### 6.1 User Authentication
- 100 RPS for login endpoint
- Session creation and validation
- Token refresh flow

### 6.2 Diagnosis Flow
- End-to-end diagnosis request
- Document retrieval and processing
- AI model interaction

### 6.3 Document Processing
- PDF/Image upload and processing
- Text extraction and vectorization
- Search and retrieval performance

## 7. Reporting

### 7.1 Test Reports
- Detailed performance metrics
- Comparison with baseline
- Identified bottlenecks
- Recommendations

### 7.2 Monitoring Dashboards
- Real-time performance metrics
- System health indicators
- Alert thresholds

## 8. Continuous Performance Testing

### 8.1 CI/CD Integration
- Performance tests on every merge to main
- Performance gates in deployment pipeline
- Automated performance regression detection

### 8.2 Regular Load Tests
- Weekly full load tests
- Monthly endurance tests
- Quarterly stress tests

## 9. Success Criteria
- All KPIs met under expected load
- No critical performance regressions
- Clear action items from each test cycle
- Performance improvements measured and documented
