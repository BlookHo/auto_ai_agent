# Auto AI Agent - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A web application that enables automotive experts to diagnose vehicle issues using advanced AI with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities. The system provides a structured diagnosis flow with AI-powered recommendations and supports high concurrency for professional use.

## Core Requirements

1. **User Management**
   - Authentication & authorization
   - Role-based access control

2. **Vehicle & Issue Management**
   - Vehicle information storage (make, model, year, VIN, etc.)
   - Issue categorization and documentation
   - Diagnosis history and tracking
   - Exploitation conditions logging

3. **AI-Powered Diagnosis**
   - Multi-step diagnosis flow
   - LLM integration (OpenAI GPT-4/Claude 3)
   - RAG system for enhanced accuracy
   - Dialogue-based interaction system
   - Diagnosis history and versioning

4. **Knowledge Base**
   - Technical documentation storage
   - Service bulletins and recalls
   - Common issues database
   - External data source integration

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: <2s response time for AI responses
- **Scalability**: Support for 100k+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Security**: GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails 7.1+ (Ruby 3.2+)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector
- **Caching & Pub/Sub**: Redis 7.0+
- **Background Jobs**: Sidekiq 7.0+
- **Search**: Elasticsearch 8.0+
- **API**: JSON:API specification
- **Real-time**: ActionCable (WebSockets)

### Frontend
- **Core**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**:
  - Redux Toolkit (UI state)
  - React Query (Server state)
- **UI Components**: Material-UI v5
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, memoization

### AI/ML Components
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4/Claude 3
- **Vector Database**: pgvector with HNSW index

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Data Fetching**: React Query handles all API calls and caching
2. **State Transformation**: Fetched data is transformed and stored in Redux if needed for global state
3. **UI Updates**: Components subscribe to Redux for state changes and React Query for data
4. **Mutations**:
   - Optimistic updates through React Query
   - Synchronized updates to Redux state when needed
