# Auto AI Agent - Development Plan

## Project Overview
Web application for automotive experts to diagnose vehicle issues using AI with RAG capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### Functional
1. **User Management**
   - Authentication & authorization
   - Role-based access control

2. **Vehicle Data**
   - Vehicle information storage
   - Maintenance history

3. **Diagnosis**
   - AI-powered analysis
   - RAG-enhanced recommendations

### Non-Functional
- <2s response time
- 100k+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Ruby on Rails 7.1+
- PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Redis
- Sidekiq (background jobs)
- ActionCable (WebSockets)

### Frontend
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**:
  - Redux Toolkit: UI state and business logic
  - React Query: Server state and data fetching
- Material-UI v5
- React Hook Form for form handling
- React Router v6 for navigation

### AI/ML
- OpenAI GPT-4/Claude 3
- Vector database
- Document processing

## Version Control

For detailed version control strategy, see [Version Control Documentation](./version_control.md).

Key points:
- Git-based workflow
- GitLab recommended for hosting
- Branch protection and code reviews required
- CI/CD integration

## State Management Architecture

### Redux Toolkit (Client State)
- **Purpose**: Manage UI state and business logic
- **Use Cases**:
  - Authentication state
  - UI theme and preferences
  - Form state management
  - Complex business logic flows
  - Global application state
- **Implementation**:
  - Slices for domain-specific state
  - RTK Query for API interactions requiring cache persistence
  - Redux Persist for persisting critical state

### React Query (Server State)
- **Purpose**: Handle server state and data fetching
- **Use Cases**:
  - Data fetching and caching
  - Background data updates
  - Request deduplication
  - Pagination and infinite queries
  - Optimistic updates
- **Implementation**:
  - Custom query hooks for API endpoints
  - Query invalidation strategies
  - Prefetching for better UX
  - Optimistic updates for responsive UIs

### Data Flow
1. **Data Fetching**: React Query handles all API calls and caching
2. **State Transformation**: Fetched data is transformed and stored in Redux if needed for global state
3. **UI Updates**: Components subscribe to Redux for state changes and React Query for data
4. **Mutations**:
   - Optimistic updates through React Query
   - Synchronized updates to Redux state when needed

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Database Optimization
- Implement database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Use database query optimization (includes, select, and pluck)
- Implement database read replicas for high read operations
- Use database connection pooling
- Implement query caching for complex reports

### Caching Strategy
- Fragment caching for complex views
- Russian Doll caching for nested resources
- Low-level caching for expensive calculations
- HTTP caching with ETags and Last-Modified headers
- Redis for session storage and cache

### Background Processing
- Use Sidekiq for all non-critical path operations
- Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- Queue management with priority queues
- Job idempotency and retry mechanisms

### Frontend Performance
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Asset pipeline optimization
- Server-side rendering where beneficial
- Client-side caching strategies
- Optimistic UI updates

### AI/ML Performance
- Batch processing of documents for embedding
- Vector search optimization
- Cache AI model responses
- Implement request batching for AI API calls
- Use streaming responses for long-running AI operations

## Performance Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Load Testing**: Simulate 100k+ concurrent users
- **Stress Testing**: Identify breaking points
- **Endurance Testing**: Check for memory leaks
- **Scalability Testing**: Vertical and horizontal scaling

### Tools
- k6 for load testing
- New Relic for APM
- Skylight for Rails performance monitoring
- Rack Mini Profiler for development
- Bullet for N+1 query detection

### Metrics to Monitor
- Response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates
- Database query performance
- Background job queue times
- Memory and CPU usage
